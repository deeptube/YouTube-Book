##Innovative Idea
Our application Youtube Book is similar to a personal library where you can catalog your favorite Youtube videos. This is similar to mybooklist.com where you can list your favorite books. Youtube has playlists but doesn’t have the ability to add notes or data about the video. Youtube Book is unique because users can paste their youtube link and it will organize their videos by the category through Youtube’s Data API and also embed it as a watchable iframe. 
Along with labels like Calc3, notes, and video bookmark timestamps, users can streamline their youtube videos in a single label group with easily accessible timestamps. This is better than just pasting links because the videos can be watched directly from our web site.

##Important Components
Our 2 main components will be the Youtube video category and the user inputted data about the video. The types of data we will be processing from the user is the Video title, Video Label, Video notes, and Video Bookmark Timestamps. The major components of each video will be the video category which we will fetch from the Youtube Data API and it will automatically sort their video in a category like education or entertainment. After, the user will enter in a label to further categorize their video like calc 3 or funny videos. From there the user will enter in the title, notes, and any bookmark timestamps.
Data processed: [Video category], [Video title, Video Label, Video notes, and Video Bookmark Timestamps]

How about the video file itself?
Also we should think about creation, reading, updating, and deletion capabilities. I suppose adding, and removing videos from the book would cover these but I’m not too sure
